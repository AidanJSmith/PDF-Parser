After a long journey from her \\nhome in England, eight-year-old Jessamy is meeting her \\nmother\\u2019s family in Nigeria for the first time.\\n\\n\\nThere they all stood, an uncertain circle, and then \\nher grandfather came forward, greeted her mother, \\nshook hands with her father. Although he seemed \\nmellower and smaller than the picture that her \\nmother had painted for her over the years, Jess had a \\nsudden and irrational fear that he might start \\nshouting at her. \\nHe looked at her, put his hands on his hips in \\nmock consternation, and her cousins and her mother \\nlaughed. Her father, standing slightly outside the \\ncircle, smiled encouragingly at her. Her grandfather \\nheld out a hand. His hands were big and square, \\nspadelike, the palms deeply etched and callused. She \\ntook a step towards him, smiling a wobbly, nervous \\nsmile that she could not feel on her face. \\nShe did not know what was expected of her. \\nShe had nearly reached him when suddenly, on an \\noutward gust of air, he half said, half announced a \\nname. \\n\\u201cWuraola.\\u201d \\nWho? \\nShe froze, not knowing what to say or do. \\nOf course, she knew that Wuraola was her \\nYoruba1 name, the name that her grandfather had \\nasked in a letter for her to be called when her mother\\n\\nhad held her Nigerian naming ceremony. Wuraola \\nmeans gold. \\nShe knew all this . . . \\nBut nobody had ever called her Wuraola, not even \\nher mother, whom she could now see from the \\ncorner of her eye making anxious, silent gestures for \\nher to go to her grandfather. \\nHere, in this stone-walled corridor where the \\nsunlight came in through enormous, stiff mosquito \\nscreens over every window and her clothes clung to \\nher like another skin, Wuraola sounded like another \\nperson. Not her at all. \\nShould she answer to this name, and by doing so \\nsteal the identity of someone who belonged here? \\nShould she . . . become Wuraola? \\nBut how? \\nShe could not make herself move forward, so she \\nstayed where she was, avoided his touch, looked up \\ninto her grandfather\\u2019s face, smiled and said quietly, \\nbut firmly, in her most polite voice \\u201cHello, \\nGrandfather.\\u201d \\nAfter they had taken baths and Jess had been \\nmade to eat a little, her mother disappeared with her \\nyoungest sister, Aunty Biola, and her father \\nbefriended Uncle Kunle, who was clearly as \\nnewspaper-minded as he was, and wanted to talk \\nabout politics. Swiftly dropping a kiss onto her \\nforehead, her father released her into her \\ngrandfather\\u2019s clutches before mounting the stairs that \\nled up to the roof balcony of the house. \\nSo her grandfather did have a face. It was a broad, \\nlined face; the smile and frown lines ran deep into his \\nDIRECTIONS\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nskin, his eyes made smaller by the loosened flesh \\naround them. He had the same wide, strong jawline \\nwith the determined set as her mother, and the same \\nprominent cheekbones, although Jess could see that \\nhis were made angular more through the emaciation \\nof age than anything else.

Groh, Making \\nSpace: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are. \\u00a92014 by \\nJennifer M. Groh.\\n\\n\\nThe implication of the overlap between areas of \\nthe brain responsible for cognition and areas \\nresponsible for sensory and motor processing is that \\nperhaps the operations of cognition are implemented \\nat least in part via sensory and motor structures. That \\nis, perhaps \\u201cthinking\\u201d also involves activating some \\nsubset of sensory and motor pathways of the brain. \\nFor example, when you mentally picture sitting on \\nthe couch in your living room, that thought might be \\nimplemented by partially activating the visual, tactile, \\nauditory, olfactory, and motor responses that would \\nhave occurred if you were actually there. The theory \\nthat thought might involve simulating the activity \\npatterns in our sensory and motor areas of the brain \\nis called grounded or embodied cognition. \\nSome of the evidence in favor of this view comes \\nfrom behavioral experiments that show that how you \\nrespond to something depends on otherwise \\nirrelevant features of the sensory stimulus. And of \\nparticular interest here, these seemingly irrelevant \\nfeatures often involve space. In one classic study, \\nMike Tucker and Rob Ellis at the University of \\nPlymouth asked subjects to judge whether items were \\nupside down or right side up. The stimuli consisted \\nof photographs of common household objects like \\nfrying pans or spatulas. Subjects were to indicate \\ntheir choice by pressing a designated button, one \\nbutton for upright and the other for upside down. \\nOne button was placed near the subject\\u2019s left hand \\nand the other near the right hand\\u2014a detail we \\nwouldn\\u2019t normally consider to be important but that \\nwas essential for what Tucker and Ellis were really \\ngetting at. \\nSecretly, Tucker and Ellis were not particularly \\ninterested in the upright/inverted choices, but \\nwhether the subjects would respond faster when they \\nhad to press the button with the hand on the same \\nside as the handle of the object in the photograph. All \\nthe objects had handles and were photographed in \\nmultiple orientations, upright with the handle on \\neither the left or right, and inverted with the handle \\non either the left or right. Tucker and Ellis found that \\nwhen the handle on the frying pan was on the left, \\nresponses involving the left hand were indeed faster\\n\\nthan those involving the right. Subjects also made \\nfewer errors when the correct choice involved a \\nmatch between the hand and the handle. When the \\nobjects were mirror reversed, the response pattern \\nreversed as well, indicating that it was not simply a \\nmatter of being faster or more accurate with one \\nhand than the other. \\nAnother classic illustration of a seemingly \\nunnecessary connection between space and cognition \\ncomes from mental rotation experiments. In one \\nearly study, Roger Shepard and Jacqueline Metzler \\npresented subjects with drawings of blocks of various \\nshapes (think Tetris but in three dimensions) and \\nasked them to judge whether two pictures involved \\nthe same shape from a different viewpoint or a \\ndifferent shape altogether. They found that how long \\nit took the subjects to make the judgment varied \\nproportionally with the amount of rotation that \\nwould have been needed to bring the two objects into \\nalignment, had they been real. \\nBoth of these experiments, although strictly \\nbehavioral, suggest that mental reasoning can show \\nsignatures of real-world spatial constraints. In the \\nfrying-pan experiment, there is no reason for the side \\nof the handle to affect responses\\u2014subjects must \\nmerely indicate whether the frying pan is upright or \\nnot\\u2014but it does. In the case of the mental rotation, \\nthere is no physical object to be actually turned, and \\nyet the amount of time required to perform the task \\nvaries with how far such an object would have \\nneeded to be turned if it did exist.\\n\\nEffect of Object Orientation and\\n\\nResponse Hand on Response Time \\nObject handle \\norientation \\nResponse \\nhand \\nMean response time \\n(milliseconds) \\nLeft \\nLeft hand .2 \\nLeft \\nRight hand .8 \\nRight \\nLeft hand .8 \\nRight \\nRight hand .3 \\nAdapted from Mike Tucker and Rob Ellis, \\u201cOn the Relations between \\nSeen Objects and Components of Potential Actions.\\u201d \\u00a91998 by \\nAmerican Psychological Association, Inc.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich choice best represents the overall structure of \\nthe passage?

UVB radiation can damage DNA;\\n\\nDNA photolyase is an enzyme that can repair DNA damage.\\n\\n\\nAndrew Blaustein, an ecologist at the University \\nof Oregon, has studied frogs for decades, and for the \\npast ten years he has turned his attention to the role \\nof UV radiation in population declines. Like many \\nectotherms (animals formerly known as cold-\\nblooded), some frog species lay their eggs in sunlit \\nponds or puddles, expressly relying on the sun\\u2019s \\nenergy to speed along egg hatching, larval \\ndevelopment, and metamorphosis before their \\nephemeral pond dries. Much like photosynthesis or \\nvitamin D production, it\\u2019s a trade-off\\u2014in the frog\\u2019s \\ncase, faster development in a higher-risk \\nenvironment. Of course, like most creatures living \\nunder the sun, amphibians are well defended against \\nUVB radiation. In addition to behavioral changes, \\nlike burrowing in mud or laying eggs in logs or under \\nrocks, and the production of natural sunscreens, \\namphibians have redundant systems for DNA repair, \\nincluding DNA photolyase. \\nInterested in the level of protection afforded by \\nDNA photolyase, and the potential impacts of \\nincreased UVB exposures on frog populations, \\nBlaustein and coauthor Lisa Belden compared the life \\nhistory habits of several amphibian species with \\nDNA photolyase activity in their eggs. Their study \\nreveals strong positive correlations between UVB-\\nresistant frog species (a species, for example, whose \\neggs are normally most exposed to sunlight because \\nthey are laid in sunny shallow ponds) and increased \\nphotolyase activity, in comparison to species whose \\neggs tend to be protected from direct sunlight. In \\nother words, frog species that lay their eggs in sun-\\ndrenched environments are better able to repair \\nDNA damage caused by UVB. Not only that, but \\nsubsequent field studies confirmed the detrimental \\neffects of naturally occurring levels of UVB to \\ndeveloping eggs of some frog species, while those \\nwith the highest concentration of photolyase, the \\nPacific tree frogs, were most resistant. Beyond killing \\nembryos, write Blaustein and Belden, UVB exposure \\nmay also cause sublethal and potential subtle (and \\ntherefore more difficult to measure) effects on larval \\ngrowth and development. Their findings raise an\\n\\nintriguing question. Are less-resistant species more \\nsusceptible to DNA damage caused by increased \\nUVB? \\nThe question was answered in part by researchers \\nworking with a single species of frogs inhabiting \\ndifferent altitudes of the French Alps. Frog \\npopulations adapted to life at higher altitudes, and \\ntherefore naturally higher UVB exposures, showed \\nless DNA damage than did their lower-altitude \\nbrethren when exposed to UVB intensities typical of \\nhigh altitude. Identifying the genetic mechanism of \\nthis adaption\\u2014rapid evolution, increased protein \\nproduction, or both\\u2014will require further study. \\nAlthough DNA photolyase concentrations were not \\nmeasured, the authors report an interesting twist that \\nsuggests increased photolyase activity in high-\\naltitude tadpoles. Interested in other ways frogs \\nmight experience DNA damage, they studied the \\neffects of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a well-characterized \\ncarcinogen present in cigarette smoke, coal tar, oil, \\nand myriad other combustion products. BaP is both \\nan ancient toxicant and a major industrial pollutant. \\nActivated BaP binds with DNA, causing a kink in the \\nDNA helix, just like UVB. A specialty of DNA \\nphotolyase is kinky DNA. It turns out that high-\\naltitude frogs had less BaP-induced DNA damage \\ncompared with their lowland cousins. Added \\nprotection by DNA photolyase? Maybe. Until \\nenzyme concentrations are confirmed, any added \\nprotection cannot yet be attributed to increased DNA \\nphotolyase.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1 \\nPhotolyase \\n\\nBased on the passage, which situation is most similar \\nto that described in lines 10-13 (\\u201cMuch . . . \\nenvironment\\u201d)? \\n\\n\\n\", {\"22\": \"Based on the passage, which situation is most similar \\nto that described in lines 10-(\\u201cMuch . . . \\nenvironment\\u201d)? \\nA) A male elk that expends considerable energy to \\ngrow large antlers \\nB) A deer that forages in an area with plentiful \\nresources in close proximity to predators \\nC) A bird that experiences rapid bone growth while \\nlosing bone strength \\nD) A turtle that produces a small clutch of eggs \\nbecause resources are scarce \\n\", \"23\": \"The passage indicates that burrowing in mud may \\nbenefit some amphibians by \\nA) delaying egg hatching and larval development. \\nB) repairing damage caused by UVB. \\nC) limiting their exposure to sunlight. \\nD) reducing their need to produce sunscreen. \\n\", \"24\": \"Based on the passage, it can most reasonably be \\ninferred from the research conducted in the French \\nAlps that\", \"25\": \"Which choice provides the best evidence for the \\nanswer to the previous question? \\nA) Lines 47-(\\u201cThe question . . .

In this passage, Warren \\naddresses the time period directly following the American \\nRevolution.\\n\\n\\nBut though the connexion was now dissolved, and \\nthe gordian knot of union between Great Britain and \\nAmerica cut in sunder; though the independence of \\nthe United States was, by the treaty, clearly \\nestablished on the broad basis of liberty; yet the \\nAmericans felt themselves in such a state of infancy, \\nthat as a child just learning to walk, they were afraid \\nof their own movements. Their debts were unpaid, \\ntheir governments unsettled, and the people out of \\nbreath by their long struggle for the freedom and \\nindependence of their country. They were become \\npoor from the loss of trade, the neglect of their usual \\noccupations, and the drains from every quarter for \\nthe support of a long and expensive war. \\nFrom the versatility of human affairs, and the \\nencroaching spirit of man, it was yet uncertain when \\nand how the states would be tranquillized, and the \\nunion consolidated, under wise, energetic, and free \\nmodes of government; or whether such, if \\nestablished, would be administered agreeable to laws \\nfounded on the beautiful theory of republicanism, \\ndepictured in the closets of philosophers, and \\nidolized in the imagination of most of the inhabitants \\nof America. \\nIt is indeed true, that from a general attention to \\nearly education, the people of the United States were \\nbetter informed in many branches of literature, than \\nthe common classes of men in most other countries. \\nYet many of them had but a superficial knowledge of \\nmankind; they were ignorant of the intrigues of \\ncourts, and though convinced of the necessity of \\ngovernment, did not fully understand its nature or \\norigin; they had generally supposed there was little to \\ndo, but to shake off the yoke of foreign domination, \\nand annihilate the name of king. \\nThey were not generally sensible, that most \\nestablished modes of strong government are usually \\nthe consequences of fraud or violence, against the \\nsystems of democratic theorists. They were not \\nsensible, that from age to age the people are flattered, \\ndeceived, or threatened, until the hood-winked \\nmultitude set their own seals to a renunciation of\\n\\ntheir privileges, and with their own hands rivet the \\nchains of servitude on their posterity. They were \\ntotally fearless of the intrigues or the ambition of \\ntheir own countrymen, which might in time render \\nfruitless the expense of their blood and their \\ntreasures. These they had freely lavished to secure \\ntheir equality of condition, their easy modes of \\nsubsistence, and their exemption from public \\nburdens beyond the necessary demands for the \\nsupport of a free and equal government.

Passage 2 is adapted \\nfrom John R. Squires et al., \\u201cMissing Lynx and Trophic \\nCascades in Food Webs: A Reply to Ripple et al.\\u201d \\u00a92012 by \\nThe Wildlife Society. A trophic cascade occurs when the \\npresence of a predator decreases the population of its prey, \\nthereby increasing the numbers of organisms at the next-\\nlower trophic level. \\nPassage 1\\n\\n\\nIn the early 2000s, wolves began to drift down \\nfrom Canada and across the border from Idaho into \\nWashington State. This natural wolf recolonization \\ninspired ecologists such as William Ripple and his \\ncolleagues to conduct an exercise in scientific \\nthinking to consider potential impacts that an apex \\npredator like the wolf would have on the intricate \\nworkings of the lynx-snowshoe hare food web. At the \\ntime, Washington had low hare and lynx populations \\nand a high coyote population. Coyotes had recently \\nexpanded their range and abundance there. Wolves \\nprey on coyotes. What if the wolf\\u2019s return to the \\nPacific Northwest could indirectly improve lynx \\nconservation, via trophic cascade effects? \\nRipple and colleagues hypothesized that two \\nmechanisms would drive wolf-coyote-lynx-snowshoe \\nhare trophic cascades. First, by killing coyotes, \\nwolves would reverse the mesopredator release that \\nhad occurred when wolves had been extirpated from \\nthis region nearly a century earlier. When humans \\nhunted wolves to extinction, they removed an \\nimportant check on coyote numbers\\u2014creating a \\n\\u201crelease\\u201d on the numbers of this mid-sized predator. \\nCoyote numbers increased, which put more pressure \\non lynx via competition for food resources such as \\nsnowshoe hares. Therefore, by reducing coyotes in \\nthis system, a returning wolf population could \\nindirectly create ecological benefits for lynx. The \\nresearchers further hypothesized that because \\ncoyotes also prey on lynx, a reduction of coyote \\nnumbers by wolves would release predation pressure \\non lynx. \\nSecond, in western North America, south of the \\nUS-Canada border, wolves prey primarily on elk and \\ndeer. When elk and deer numbers are high, these \\nherbivores can suppress shrubs via heavy browsing. \\nRipple and colleagues hypothesized that the wolf\\u2019s \\nreturn would reduce elk and deer numbers and also\\n\\nchange their behavior, as has been found in places \\nlike Yellowstone by John Laundr\\u00e9 and others. Elk \\nand deer need to stay alert in order to survive in areas \\nwhere wolves exist. This means keeping their heads \\nup and spending less time standing in one spot with \\ntheir heads down, as they typically do when there are \\nno wolves in a system. Via this predation risk \\nmechanism, wolves could indirectly reduce browsing \\npressure on shrubs, which would improve snowshoe \\nhare habitat, thereby benefiting lynx. \\nPassage 2\\n\\nRipple et al. correctly state that wolves can affect \\ncoyotes, both behaviorally and ecologically, in the \\nGreater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), as shown by \\nBerger and Gese, and that such regulation can have \\ncascading effects. However, despite the well-\\npublicized initial declines in coyote abundance in the \\nGYE following wolf recovery, coyotes may now be \\nadapting to wolves and coyote pack numbers may \\nhave rebounded. The trophic strength of wolf effects \\non coyotes may also differ geographically with \\nvariation in climate, primary productivity, carnivore \\nand prey communities, and the degree of human \\npersecution. The inverse relationship between wolves \\nand coyotes in Yellowstone is not supported outside \\nthe two national parks (Yellowstone and Grand \\nTeton) included in the analyses by Berger and Gese. \\nIn other systems where wolves, coyotes, and lynx \\ncoexist, research shows a positive relationship \\nbetween wolves and coyotes, whereby coyotes benefit \\nfrom scavenging on wolf-killed ungulate carcasses. \\nThe generally low mortality rates of radio-collared \\ncoyotes killed by wolves outside of Yellowstone in \\nNorthwest Montana is three times less than those \\nkilled by cougars. Thus, this quick review of the \\nliterature suggests that the strongest generality of \\nRipple et al.\\u2019s hypothesis that wolves have a direct \\nnegative effect on coyotes is, at best, inconsistent, \\nboth within the GYE and across wolf-coyote range in \\nNorth America. \\nBuskirk et al. hypothesized that coyotes compete \\nwith lynx through both interference competition \\n(direct killing or displacement) and indirect \\nexploitative competition for shared food resources. \\nRipple et al. speculated that these interactions are, in \\npart, responsible for the imperiled status of southern \\nlynx. Unfortunately, evidence for interference \\ncompetition is essentially limited to anecdotal \\nobservations. An observation of a single juvenile lynx\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\nkilled by a coyote in the Yukon is not prima facie [at \\nfirst sight] evidence for a trophic-level interaction. \\nFurther, in this northern population, more predation \\nmortality of radio-collared lynx was attributed to \\nwolves, wolverines, and other lynx than to coyotes. \\nDirect interactions between coyotes and lynx were \\nrare.\\n\\nOne important function of the first paragraph of \\nPassage 1 is to \\n\\n\\nWhich choice best describes the relationship between \\nthe passages? \\n\", {\"43\": \"One important function of the first paragraph of \\nPassage is to \\nA) assert the strength of the assumptions that \\ninformed the hypothesis that Ripple and his \\ncolleagues developed. \\nB) describe the ecological situation that Ripple and \\nhis colleagues considered. \\nC) define important concepts that Ripple and his \\ncolleagues employed in their research. \\nD) compare behavioral traits of the animals that \\nRipple and his colleagues studied. \\n\", \"44\": \"As used in line 16, \\u201cdrive\\u201d most nearly means \\nA) cause. \\nB) convey. \\nC) operate. \\nD) repulse. \\n\", \"45\": \"Passage indicates that Ripple and his colleagues \\nwould expect to find that in areas where wolves have \\nreturned, elk and deer \\nA) feed on fewer varieties of shrubs than do elk and \\ndeer in areas where no wolves are found. \\nB) exist in lower numbers than they did prior to the \\nlocal extermination of wolves. \\nC) graze for shorter periods without interruption \\nthan they did before the return of wolves. \\nD) demonstrate less fearful behavior toward coyotes \\nthan toward wolves. \\n\", \"46\": \"Which choice from Passage best supports the idea \\nthat findings about the effect of wolves on coyotes in \\nsome locations may not be representative of the \\neffects of wolves on coyotes in all locations? \\nA) Lines 49-(\\u201cRipple . . . effects\\u201d) \\nB) Lines 53-(\\u201cHowever . . . rebounded\\u201d) \\nC) Lines 61-(\\u201cThe inverse . . .

Elgin arrived with \\na permit from officials of the Ottoman Empire, which \\nthen occupied  34  Greece.  Granting him permission to \\nmake drawings and casts of the sculptures; the permit \\nalso allowed him to \\u201ctake away any pieces of stone with \\ninscriptions or figures.\\u201d After finding that many of the \\nParthenon sculptures had been harmed and that others \\nwere being sold to tourists, Elgin decided to take full \\nadvantage of the permit and arranged to take many of the \\nsculptures to Britain.
